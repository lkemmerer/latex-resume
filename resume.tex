\section{Experience}
\cventry{Sept 2016 to present}{Software Engineer/Team Lead}{ShiftWise}{Portland, OR}{}{As part of the platform team, I helped create the infrastructure for an event-driven application that process high volumes of data and feeds into our reporting team's data lake. It relies on AWS SQS/SNS and Akka's actor system. In February I was made team lead. In addition to existing duties, I facilitate communication with management, other teams, and stakeholders and advocate for my team and their needs.\newline{}\newline{}Recently, I've been supporting another team as they convert our Windows-based .NET microservices to Linux and AWS tools.}
\cventry{Jan 2016 to Sept 2016}{Software Development Engineer in Test}{ShiftWise}{Portland, OR}{}{I built and maintained testing infrastructure for a next generation vendor management system. I provided guidance about good testing practices and ways to design more maintainable systems through hands-on collaboration and code/test reviews of our C\# and AngularJS application. I and my fellow SDETs promoted communication between teams and propagated evolving design patterns and testing strategies.}
\cventry{Aug 2015 to Jan 2016}{Remote Software Engineer/Contractor}{Zivity}{San Francisco, CA}{}{Using Rails and Backbone, I implemented features for a crowdfunding service that integrates with their existing site.}
\cventry{Feb to May 2015}{Technical Consultant}{Renew Financial}{Portland, OR}{}{I initially worked with the product team to add new features using AngularJS and Ruby. Due to looming deadlines, the QA team asked that I move to their team full time.\newline {
I pair-programmed with QA, mentoring in Ruby and OOP skills. I improved their home-spun framework, making tests more maintainable and less error-prone.}
}
\cventry{May 2014 to Jan 2015}{Software Engineer}{CrowdCompass}{Portland, OR}{}{As part of a cross-functional agile team, I collaborated to deliver a one-to-one messaging feature. I worked with devops to foster a more service-oriented architecture. I functioned as the liaison between my team and the 3rd party whose service we leveraged.
\newline{}\newline {
I maintained and added features to our monolithic Rails apps. In doing so, I increased test coverage and refactored in order to simplify future work to separate functionality into independent services. I also instituted daily standup for the server team and pushed for mandatory code reviews. This helped bring about an environment more conducive to knowledge sharing and mentorship.}
}
\cventry{May 2013 to May 2014}{Senior Software Engineer}{Renewable Funding (now Renew Financial)}{Portland, OR}{}{I designed and implemented well-factored, service-oriented architecture and features for green-energy-financing applications and loan processing software. I maintained existing projects and contributed to a page-object-model framework for use with Cucumber.
}
\cventry{Mar 2010 to May 2013}{Software Developer}{Renewable Funding (now Renew Financial)}{Portland, OR}{}{
Using BDD and TDD, I developed features for a multi-tenant Rails application. This app provided homeowners with energy efficiency information and connections to contractors and financing. I contributed to GIS (postgis) functionality that enabled property-specific savings calculations.
I standardized energy retrofit data from local governments and utilities and used the results to created a data warehouse for reporting purposes.
}
\cventry{Nov 2007 to Mar 2010}{Software Engineer}{Harland Financial Solutions (acquired by D+H)}{Portland, OR}{}{
 I gathered requirements for internal applications that increased user efficiency and revenue recognition. I designed, developed, and maintained these apps using ASP.NET MVC, Web Forms, and Winforms. I advocated for code reviews and other process improvements.
}
\cventry{Apr to Nov 2007}{QA Engineer}{Harland Financial Solutions (acquired by D+H)}{Portland, OR}{}{
I worked with clients and engineers to clarify requirements for internal web applications. I performed manual testing, then aided in the debugging process by pinpointing errors and fixing bugs. Later, I began performing maintenance on existing applications while learning the value of TDD.
}
\cventry{Apr 2006 to Jan 2007}{Lead QA Techician/defacto Customer Support}{Instant Media}{Portland, OR}{}{
 I was responsible for giving final sign-off on builds and database changes. I maintained test documentation and plans for our internet TV/RSS feed Windows application. I performed ad-hoc, scenario, and usability testing.
 \newline {
I managed outsourced technical support representatives and integrated feedback into design requirements.}
}

\section{Education}
\cventry{2001--2006}{B.S. Computer Engineering}{Penn State University}{University Park, PA}{\textit{Grade}}{In addition to gaining a degree, I worked as Lead Technology Tutor for a program that tutored faculty in how to use computers and managed tutor scheduling and assignment.  I also spent a summer working as a research assistant in the Human Computer Interaction lab. During that time, I participated in organizing a conference to help foster communication between non-profits about how they use technology.  }  % arguments 3 to 6 can be left empty
