\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item[$\star$]I worked closely with developers and clients in an agile development environment to determine, test, and implement design requirements for internal web applications. I logged defects and began aiding in the debugging process by pinpointing the error and fixing bugs. With the help of TDD, I became familiar with C\# and ASP.NET and moved on to performing maintenance on existing applications.
	\item[$\star$]After eight months, I was promoted to Software Engineer where I performed requirements gathering and end-to-end design, development, and maintenance of many internal ASP.NET 3.5 web applications. Varied in scope and purpose, these applications focused on streamlining process, increasing user efficiency, reducing paper waste, and increasing revenue recognition. I also advocated for better development processes such as instituting code reviews and thorough documentation for each phase of our development life cycle for auditing purposes.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item[$\star$]I served as lead tester for an internet TV and RSS feed Windows application and notified project manager when     builds or database changes were thoroughly tested and ready for release. Although I was a black-box tester, I worked with the engineering team on unit tests, as well as performing ad-hoc, scenario, and usability testing. I created and maintained test matrices for the company’s websites and the client application and managed Tier 1 technical support representatives while integrating support feedback and usability suggestions into design requirements.

	\item[$\star$]I tutored faculty in the university’s course management system and other commonly used applications. As leadtutor, I implemented an efficient one-on-one CMS (course management system) tutoring program that helped about 300 faculty clients during my time at PSU and increased the efficiency of the overall tutoring program’s record keeping and tutor assignment 10-fold. I was also part of a small group that beta-tested an online grade book that interfaced with Penn State’s CMS.
