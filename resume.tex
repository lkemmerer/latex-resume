\section{Experience}
\cventry{Sept 2017 to present}{Software Engineer}{Flightglobal}{Portland, OR}{}{I built the groundwork for a flexible and high performance flight and traveler matching engine. I added features to our traveler services suite of products using microservices built with Java, JavaScript, and Python. We also worked on rewriting the remainder of a 15-year-old Java monolith and refactoring our Angular and Backbone front-ends to use React and Redux.}

In addition to existing duties, I facilitate communication with management, other teams, and stakeholders and advocate for my team and their needs.\newline{}\newline{}I also supporting another team as they converted our Windows-based .NET microservices to run on Linux in AWS.}
\cventry{Jan 2016 to Sept 2016}{Software Development Engineer in Test}{ShiftWise}{Portland, OR}{}{I built and maintained testing infrastructure for a next generation vendor management system. I provided guidance about good testing practices and ways to design more maintainable systems through hands-on collaboration and code/test reviews of our C\# and AngularJS application. I and my fellow SDETs promoted communication between teams and propagated evolving design patterns and testing strategies.}
\cventry{Aug 2015 to Jan 2016}{Remote Software Engineer/Contractor}{Zivity}{San Francisco, CA}{}{Using Rails and Backbone, I implemented features for a crowdfunding service that integrates with their existing site.}
\cventry{Feb to May 2015}{Technical Consultant}{Renew Financial}{Portland, OR}{}{I initially worked with the product team to add new features using AngularJS and Ruby. Due to looming deadlines, the QA team asked that I move to their team full time.\newline {
I pair-programmed with QA, mentoring in Ruby and OOP skills. I improved their home-spun framework, making tests more maintainable and less error-prone.}

I worked with devops to foster a more service-oriented architecture. I functioned as the liaison between my team and the 3rd party whose service we leveraged.
\newline{}\newline {
I maintained and added features to our monolithic Rails apps. In doing so, I increased test coverage and refactored in order to simplify future work to separate functionality into independent services. I also instituted daily standup for the server team and pushed for mandatory code reviews. This helped bring about an environment more conducive to knowledge sharing and mentorship.}

}
\cventry{Apr to Nov 2007}{QA Engineer}{Harland Financial Solutions (acquired by D+H)}{Portland, OR}{}{

\section{Education}
\cventry{2001--2006}{B.S.
