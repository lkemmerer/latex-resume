    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[$\star$]At RF I collaborated with a large team of developers to maintain a multi-tenant Rails application that focused on educating homeowners about energy efficiency and connected them with contractors and financing to make green improvements on their property.  Components for the app included an in-house CMS and GIS funcationality that enabled tailored energy and cost savings calculations to our visitors.  We are currently standardizing energy retrofit data from local governments and utility providers for California with plans to use the data warehouse we create to drive further adoption of green energy measures.

    \end{ncolumn}
    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[$\star$]I worked closely with the agile development team and its clients to determine, test, and implement design requirements for internal web applications. I logged defects and aided in the debugging process by pinpointing error sources and fixing bugs. With the help of TDD, I became familiar with C\# and ASP.NET and moved on to performing maintenance on existing applications.
	    \item[$\star$]After being promoted to software engineer, I performed requirements gathering and end-to-end design, development, and maintenance of a range of internal web and desktop applications. Varied in scope and purpose, these apps focused on streamlining process, increasing user efficiency, reducing paper waste, and increasing revenue recognition. I also advocated for better development processes such as instituting code reviews and thoroughly documenting each phase of our development life cycle for auditing purposes.

    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[$\star$]As lead tester for an internet TV and RSS feed Windows application, I notified project manager when builds or database changes were thoroughly tested and ready for release. Although I was a black-box tester, I worked with the engineering team on unit tests, as well as performing ad-hoc, scenario, and usability testing. I created and maintained test documentation for the company’s websites and our product and managed Tier 1 technical support representatives while integrating support feedback and usability suggestions into design requirements.

    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[$\star$]I tutored faculty in the university’s course management system and other commonly used applications. As lead tutor, I implemented an efficient one-on-one CMS (course management system) tutoring program that helped 300 faculty clients during my time at PSU and increased the efficiency of the program’s record keeping and tutor assignment system 10-fold. I was also part of a small group that beta-tested an online grade book that interfaced with Penn State’s CMS.

	    \item[$\star$]I aided in the organization and execution of the first technology conference to foster communication among area non-profits about their technology usage, which was attended by over 50 organizations. I also copy-edited research papers submitted to ACM journals and transcribed interviews with research subjects.
