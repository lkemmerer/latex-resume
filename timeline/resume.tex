          \vspace{1.5mm}
          \begin{minipage}{1.0\textwidth}\hspace{5mm}
          I developed features for a multi-tenant Rails application that educated homeowners about energy efficiency and connected them with contractors and financing to make improvements on their property.  In conjunction, I contributed to the GIS (postgis) functionality that enabled energy and cost savings calculations that were tailored to visitors' properties.  I standardized energy retrofit data from CA local governmentsw and utility providers and dabbled with data warehousing by maintaining several sets of data in types 1 (with star schema) and 2 slowly changing dimension tables.

          \vspace{1.5mm}
          \begin{minipage}{1.0\textwidth}\hspace{5mm}
	      As software engineer, I performed requirements gathering and end-to-end design, development, and maintenance of internal web and desktop applications which streamlined process, increased user efficiency and revenue recognition, and reduced paper waste.  I also advocated for better development processes such as instituting code reviews and thoroughly documenting each phase of our SDLC.

          \vspace{1.5mm}
          \begin{minipage}{1.0\textwidth}\hspace{5mm}
	      I determined, tested, and implemented requirements for internal web applications by working closely with programmers and clients.  I logged defects and aided in the debugging process by pinpointing error sources and fixing bugs. With the help of TDD, I became familiar with C\# and ASP.NET and moved on to perform maintenance on existing applications.

          \begin{minipage}{1.0\textwidth}\hspace{5mm}
        As lead QA tech, I was responsible for giving final sign-off on builds and database changes before production releases.  I performed ad-hoc, scenario, and usability testing of our internet TV and RSS feed Windows application and maintained test documentation for our websites and products.  I also managed Tier 1 technical support representatives while integrating support feedback and usability suggestions into design requirements.

	      I tutored faculty in the university's course management system and other commonly used applications. I also implemented an efficient one-on-one CMS (course management system) tutoring program that helped 300 faculty clients and increased the efficiency of record keeping and tutor assignment 10-fold.

	      I aided in the organization and execution of the first technology conference to foster communication among area non-profits about their technology usage, which was attended by over 50 organizations. I also copy-edited Human-Computer Interation research papers submitted to ACM journals and transcribed interviews with research subjects.
